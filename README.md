NaturalMC is an upcoming resource pack for Minecraft. This resource pack will be using a combination of multiple resource packs and combining them into one simple resource pack for you to use. The full list of Resource packs used in this resource pack will be announced at a later date. This project is still being worked on and does **not** have a set release date yet.

*This resource pack is very new, it's currently just an idea. Once I start designing the resource pack, I'll begin to release versions of the resource pack. Until then, this pack will be unavailable for download.*
