# ![NaturalMC](https://i.imgur.com/wOQzmom.gif) What is NaturalMC?
NaturalMC is an upcoming resource pack for Minecraft. This resource pack will be using a combination of multiple resource packs and combining them into one simple resource pack for you to use. The full list of Resource packs used in this resource pack will be announced at a later date. This project is still being worked on and does **not** have a set release date yet.


# ![NaturalMC](https://i.imgur.com/wOQzmom.gif) Release Date?
*This resource pack is very new, it's currently just an idea. Once I start designing the resource pack, I'll begin to release versions of the resource pack. Until then, this pack will be unavailable for download.*


# ![NaturalMC](https://i.imgur.com/wOQzmom.gif) Plans for NaturalMC
*My plans for NaturalMC is to make this resource pack look realistic while keeping it's authentic style at the same time. I'll only be making slight changes to the resource pack. I will also be combining multiple resource packs into one resource pack.*
